# StarkMinds-SmartContracts

StarkMinds-SmartContracts is the dedicated repository for all Stellar smart contracts powering StarkMindsâ€”a pioneering blockchain education platform built on Stellar. Developed using Soroban, these smart contracts handle on-chain interactions such as course credentialing, token management, and secure data validation.

## Features

- Smart contract development using Soroban on Stellar  
- Secure, efficient on-chain logic for education and credentialing  
- Comprehensive testing suite for contract functionality  
- Modular and scalable design for future enhancements

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) (latest stable version)  
- [Stellar CLI & Soroban CLI](https://soroban.stellar.org/docs/getting-started)  
- Docker (optional, for running a local Stellar testnet)
